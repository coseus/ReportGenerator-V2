# util/control_mapper.py
"""
Self-contained control library, classifier and auto-association engine for:

  * NIS2 Directive (art. 21(2) measures)
  * ISO/IEC 27001:2022 (Annex A, all 93 controls)
  * NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (all subcategories)
  * NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 (comprehensive control set, all families)
  * IEC 62443-3-3 (all 51 System Requirements) -- OT / ICS

Everything the feature needs lives in this one file: the control catalogs,
the finding classifier (keyword + category driven, incl. OT-specific
categories), the automatic association of relevant controls across all
frameworks, the Streamlit UI helpers and the report helpers.

Streamlit is imported lazily (only inside the render_* helpers) so the logic
part can be imported anywhere (parsers, report generators, tests) without a
hard Streamlit dependency.
